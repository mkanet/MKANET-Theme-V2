# MKANET V2 color theme for Visual Studio Code

I decided to create my own gray color theme from scratch to avoid headaches I got from traditional dark and light-colored themes.  I spent a lot of time choosing precise colors for syntax coloring and the Sidebar colors and other UI components.

## The ultimate gray color theme with Vibrancy effect
